### Software Development Team Leader

_I manage a team of 6-8 software engineers_ and provide _technical leadership
over the development and maintenance of a 
[range of online applications](http://www.apppac4nfp.infoxchange.net.au)_ used
by thousands of health and community sector agencies every day. The position
requires involvement in all parts of the development process, from
project management and UX design to software architecture and simply "cutting 
code". During my time _as team leader I've transformed software development at 
Infoxchange_:

  stand-ups, user stories and burn-down charts, significantly improving 
  visibility and communication within and around the team.

  integration_, significantly improving code stability and release frequency 
  across a range of products.
* _Overseeing a major overhaul and refactoring of large legacy applications_ 
  written in Perl. Re-developing from scratch using Python/Django where 
  appropriate and morphing others into modern Perl MVC applications.
  (DBIx::Class, Mojolicious, PSGI).
* Significantly changed the developer recruitment process. Requiring job 
  candidates to  write code and spend time with the team before joining.
* Enhanced and modernized the toolset for developers. Git instead of CVS for
  source control. Redmine for project management and issue tracking. VMWare
  to simplify mimicking of and experimenting with complex server environments.
