A common bug report I receive from users who try my 
[Outlook 365 Notifer Chrome extension](#outlook_365_notifier_now_in_chrome_web_store) 
is that it doesn't work for the "new" Hotmail: [Outlook.com](http://outlook.com).
The reason: it was never meant to.

This got me browsing the Chrome Webstore for an extension that does what
these people want. To my surprise I was unable to find it. Although I'm not
a Hotmail user nor a Christian, I decided to write one. Love Thy Neighbor as 
Yourself!

After a few hours refactoring and tweaking the original extension, there we go:
An email checker for users of Microsoft's new smart and modern free inbox.

[Outlook.com Notifier](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/outlookcom-notifier/mkmomflkhdooajekmffpilpoenndjppk)

* Displays the number of unread emails
* Click on the button to open your inbox
* Optional desktop notifications

It's early days, but I'm excited to see a steady growth of user numbers and
some raving reviews for this extension!
